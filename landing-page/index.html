        <h2>Product Strategy</h2>
        <p>The most effective products start with a comprehensive market-based, insight-driven strategy. Understand
          the role that product managers play during product development, with a focus on activities that happen
          early in the product development cycle. Learn how to identify the right problems to solve through market
          research, target user definition, and market sizing. Create a compelling vision and strategy that will set up
          the team to solve those problems. Understand how to communicate effectively to get people excited and
          bought into your ideas.</P>

        <p>The inception of any product that gets built starts with a vision and a
          product manager that rallies stakeholders behind that vision. In this
          project, you will choose to act as a product manager for one of four
          top technology companies and develop a compelling pitch for the
          development of a new product. You’ll be provided a business scenario
          relevant to each of the four companies and based on the provided
          business scenario of the company you choose, you will perform
          primary and secondary market research to identify target users and
          size the market opportunity for a new product. Then, you will compile
          your analysis into a pitch deck and present the vision of your product
          to business stakeholders.</p>

        <h2>Product Design</h2>
        <p>
          Once the problem has been defined and a market opportunity has been identified, it is important to create
          a solution that is desirable by its users. Bring an idea through concept, design, and user validation, as
          well as creating a spec to handoff to engineering for development. Use design thinking methodologies to
          diverge in order to explore ideas, and then ultimately focus in and converge on a single idea. Map out the
          full concept through creation of a prototype that can be used to validate that you’re solving a problem for
          real users.</P>
        <p>The most desirable products have been built iteratively with the user
          in mind. In this project, you will take a problem/opportunity (using
          work from the previous course) through a Design Sprint. During the
          Design Sprint, you will explore multiple ideas, narrow down ideas
          to the most compelling one, create a storyboard and prototype,
          conduct user research, refine their ideas, and incorporate findings
          into a final product spec.</p>

    <section id="section3" data-nav="Product Development">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Product Development</h2>
        <p>A product is only successful if it can be feasibility built according to a dedicated timeline. Learn the critical
          soft skills needed to manage the development and execution phase of the product. Collaborate with
          cross-functional teams and business stakeholders to guide the product development team through
          planning and execution. Manage stakeholder expectations and handle risks that arise, reprioritizing
          feature and sprint priorities to tackle competing requests.</p>

        <p>Leading the development of a product so it can get shipped within
          a given timeline requires an adeptness at managing priorities,
          relationships and expectations. In this project, you will take the
          work completed in the previous course through the execution and
          development phase. First, you will compile a sprint backlog with
          a clearly defined sprint goal that reflects the prioritized user stories
          and detailed acceptance criteria. Then, you will refine the solution by
          leveraging API documentation. Then, you will create a coordination
          activities map and handle competing priorities ranging from
          production issues reported and resource constraints to stakeholder
          feedback and requests that come up during product development.</p>

    <section id="section4" data-nav="Product Launch">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Product Launch</h2>
        <p>Once a need has been defined and a product has been designed and developed, it is time to bring that
          product to the market. Learn all about the launch process and the important partners a Product Manager
          will need to work with during this phase. Create a plan, identify the launch risks and figure out how to
          minimize their impact on your launch. Collaborate with Marketing stakeholders to determine how to
          target your customers and develop a compelling message to increase engagement in your product. Work
          with Sales, Customer Support and the other teams to prepare them to interface with your customers as
          the product is launched. Execute the launch and use feedback from your customers to determine the next
          steps for your product.</p>

        <p>A product finally realizes its impact once it is delivered to customers.
          In this project, you will take the product you have developed in the
          earlier courses and bring it to market. First, you will create a
          pre-launch process, including identification of launch risks and
          mitigations, to enable launch. Then, you will develop a marketing
          and pricing strategy to communicate the value proposition of your
          product to customers. Then, you will write a user guide and other
          create other communications collateral to prepare the Sales and
          Customer Support teams to evangelize the product. Finally, you
          will use customer feedback to design an A/B test for a new product
          feature.</p>
